# VideoHelp Dark Theme

[Browser Preview](images/browser_preview.png)

## Installation
Go to the releases section and download the following file depending on your browser:
+ Firefox (Nightly): .xpi
+ Chromium-based: .zip

## Usage
Theme will automatically be applied to all pages under forum.videohelp.com. \
If a page doesn't look right, try to refresh it using `CTRL + Shift + R`, which invalidates the page cache. If it still doesn't look right e.g. a white div on a black background or similar, open an issue with a screenshot attached.
